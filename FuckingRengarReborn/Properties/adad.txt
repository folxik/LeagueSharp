    Hope you enjoy this tutorial [:)]

    (Keep in mind that this method is not 100% effective, probably 70%)

    ℬefore anything else, what you need to have for this to become possible is:


    ➫Account username and password;
    ➫An email;
    ➫Know the account info;
    ➫Knowing the victim email;
    ➫Know victim info;
     
    I will explain how you get every single thing on this list, so don't worry [;)] .


    ➫Know the account info;

    ​[spoiler]


    You can get that easily from a free League of Legends account checker (make sure that it is for the actual patch), but I prefer the SLC Checker from KillerBag it is 15$ but it is definitely worth it (link to buy it).

    The info about the account taht you will need is:


    -USERNAME


    -SUMMONER NAME


    -ACCOUNT SIGNUP EMAIL (explaning in the next topic)


    -ACCOUNT CREATION DATE:

    In here you can put the first the date of the first champion bought;


    -WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST EVER RP PURCHASE? (INCLUDE DATE AND ITEM):

    Put the first skin ever bought of the account;


    -WHAT DID YOU USE YOUR REFUND TOKENS ON?:

    Put the skins bought on the same day as (WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST EVER RP PURCHASE? (INCLUDE DATE AND ITEM);


    -THE FIRST 5 CHAMPIONS YOU HAVE PURCHASED

    ➫Knowing the victim email;

    [spoiler]


    For you to have this all you have to do is login with the victem account in the support riotgames website.
    Next press Ctrl+U (You will have something like this)

    [/spoiler]
    Next press Ctrl+F, write "email" and press Enter two times.
    And where it says null in mine, in yours should say your victim singup email.

    ➫Know victim info;

    To know this just put the email you got in google or in facebook and you can easily get his name, where he lives (that is probably the place where he created the account) and the date of birth.
